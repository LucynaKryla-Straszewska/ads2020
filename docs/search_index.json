Peng 2020-08-19 1 Welcome and Syllabus Welcome! We are very excited to have you in our two-term (one semester) course on Advanced Data Science with course numbers 140.711 and 140.712. This course is designed for PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The primary goal of the course is to teach you how to deconstruct, perform, and communicate data analyses at a professional and advanced level. This course will be conducted entirely online and will primarily use three platforms: Here on the The course assumes that you already have a background in statistics, version control with Github, and the use of the R programming language (or a suitable programming language replacement). If you don’t have the background in these materials, we will point to some resources where you can pick them up. The 1.1 About this Course 1.2 Assumptions You know the central dogma of statistics Basics of statistical inference (estimates, standard errors, basic distributions, etc.) You know how to fit and interpret statistical models Linear Models Generalized Linear Models Smoothing splines Basic mixture models You know the basics of R or Python You can read in, clean, tidy data You can fit models You can make visualizations You know the basics of reproducible research You know what version control is You know how to use Github You know how to use R/Rmarkdown 1.3 Learning Objectives You will be able to critique a data analysis and separate good from bad analysis. Specifically you will be able to: Identify the underlying question Evaluate the “arc” of the data analysis Identify the underlying type of question Identify the study design Determine if visualizations are appropriate Determine if methods are appropriate Identify pipeline issues Identify reproducibility issues Identify common fallacies and mistakes Distinguish what is a real problem from what is just hard Identify common fallacies and mistakes. Evaluate the relationship between study design, data, and claims to data justification You will be able to produce a complete data analysis. Specifically you will learn to: Translate general questions to data analysis questions Explore your data skeptically Select appropriate data analytic tools given the study design Combine appropriate data analytic tools into pipelines Identify strengths and weaknesses of data pipelines you produce Describe the results of your analysis accurately Decide what is and is not relevant to the “arc” of the data analysis Write the “arc” of the data analysis Avoid “reinventing the wheel” You will be able to produce the components of a data analytic paper: The “arc” of a data analysis Abstracts Introductions Figures Tables Methods sections Discussion/limitations sections You will be able to produce the components of a methods paper: The “arc” of a methods paper Abstracts Introductions Figures Tables Simulation sections Applications sections Discussion/limitations sections You will be able to produce the components of a data analytic presentation for technical and non-technical audiences: Problem introduction Methods Results Conclusions You will be able to identify key issues in data analytic relationships. Specifically you will be able to: Elicit objective functions from collaborators Identify types of data analysis relationships (collaboration, consultation, employment) Identify successful stategies for data analysis based on relationship type Identify key ethical issues in data analysis Understand your responsibility as a data analyst Explain the value of data science to non-technical audiences "]
