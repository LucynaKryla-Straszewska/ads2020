4. Some potential discussion questions
  - Which analyses did you prefer? Which did you trust?
  - Do you think the analysts captured signal, systematic noise, random noise? 
  - Did you feel that the analysts actually got different answers?
  - How does this make you think about your analysis choices? 
  - Were you surprised by the amount of correlation between subjective believe and analysis results? (Too high? Too low? About right?)
  - Can you think of information you would want to include an estimate of analyst variability in published results?
  - Which do you prefer? Purely recipe analysis or purely free form?
