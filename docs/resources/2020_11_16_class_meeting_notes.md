  - How was the objective function defined for comparison?
  - How were the simulated data realistic? 
  - What assumptions do the simulated data make?
  - Do they simulate a case where the methods don't work? 
  - How are the results described? Is it easy to tell what works and what doesn't?
  - Which method performed better? Does that make sense?
