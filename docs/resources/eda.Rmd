## An example EDA

As an example of an EDA we will use data from your instructor's Fitbit devices. The initial question might be something vague in nature like:

>  How has the pandemic impacted your instructor's activity levels and weight? And do his activity levels correlate with variation in his weight? 

The first step in this process involves getting some data. In this case, your instructor could get the data for you by using the [fitbitr](https://github.com/teramonagi/fitbitr) package and following this [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/06/downloading-fitbit-data-histories-with-r-2/).

One could obtain the raw data by repeated calls to the Fitbit API: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
FITBIT_KEY="redacted"
FITBIT_SECRET = "redacted"
token = fitbitr::oauth_token()

fitbit_dates = seq(ymd("2020-01-01"),ymd("2020-06-01"),by="1 day")

```
