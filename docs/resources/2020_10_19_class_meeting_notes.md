6. Some potential discussion questions
  - What do you think the sampling scheme was? How does that influence the analysis plan? 
  - This is an individual effort to collect some data since governments aren't - is this data better than no data? 
  - What do you think of the strength of the statements in the opinion piece vs the strength of evidence in the data? 
  - If you were a school superindent would you be willing to open schools on the basis of this data? Why? Why not? 
  - What data is missing? 
  - What data would you have ideally collected?
  - What do you think is the "quantity of interest" in this statistical model?
