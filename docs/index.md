# Welcome and Syllabus

Welcome! We are very excited to have you in our two-term (one semester) course on Advanced Data Science with course numbers 140.711 and 140.712. 

This course is designed for PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

> The primary goal of the course is to teach you how to deconstruct, perform, and communicate data analyses at a professional and advanced level.


This course will be conducted entirely online and will primarily use three platforms: 

1. Here on the 



The course assumes that you already have a background in statistics, version control with Github, and the use of the R programming language (or a suitable programming language replacement). If you don't have the background in these materials, we will point to some resources where you can pick them up. The

## About this Course



## Assumptions

1. You know the central dogma of  statistics
 - Basics of statistical inference (estimates, standard errors, basic distributions, etc.)
2. You know how to fit and interpret statistical models
 - Linear Models
 - Generalized Linear Models
 - Smoothing splines
 - Basic mixture models
3. You know the basics of R or Python 
 - You can read in, clean, tidy data
 - You can fit models 
 - You can make visualizations
4. You know the basics of reproducible research
 - You know what version control is
 - You know how to use Github
 - You know how to use R/Rmarkdown 
 
## Learning Objectives

1. You will be able to critique a data analysis and separate good from bad analysis. Specifically you will be able to: 
 - Identify the underlying question
 - Evaluate the "arc" of the data analysis
 - Identify the underlying type of question
 - Identify the study design 
 - Determine if visualizations are appropriate
 - Determine if methods are appropriate
 - Identify pipeline issues
 - Identify reproducibility issues
 - Identify common fallacies and mistakes
 - Distinguish what is a real problem from what is just hard
 - Identify common fallacies and mistakes. 
 - Evaluate the relationship between study design, data, and claims to data justification
2. You will be able to produce a complete data analysis. Specifically you will learn to:
 - Translate general questions to data analysis questions 
 - Explore your data skeptically
 - Select appropriate data analytic tools given the study design
 - Combine appropriate data analytic tools into pipelines
 - Identify strengths and weaknesses of data pipelines you produce
 - Describe the results of your analysis accurately 
 - Decide what is and is not relevant to the "arc" of the data analysis
 - Write the "arc" of the data analysis 
 - Avoid "reinventing the wheel"
3. You will be able to produce the components of a data analytic paper:
 - The "arc" of a data analysis
 - Abstracts
 - Introductions
 - Figures
 - Tables
 - Methods sections
 - Discussion/limitations sections
4. You will be able to produce the components of a methods paper:
 - The "arc" of a methods paper
 - Abstracts
 - Introductions
 - Figures
 - Tables
 - Simulation sections
 - Applications sections
 - Discussion/limitations sections
5. You will be able to produce the components of a data analytic presentation for technical and non-technical audiences:
 - Problem introduction
 - Methods 
 - Results 
 - Conclusions 
6. You will be able to identify key issues in data analytic relationships. Specifically you will be able to:
 - Elicit objective functions from collaborators
 - Identify types of data analysis relationships (collaboration, consultation, employment) 
 - Identify successful stategies for data analysis based on relationship type
 - Identify key ethical issues in data analysis 
 - Understand your responsibility as a data analyst 
 - Explain the value of data science to non-technical audiences
